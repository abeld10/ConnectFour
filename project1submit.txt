The below responsibilities are just generalizations, we never truly set who was in charge of what rather each individual took responsibility for what they felt most comfortable with.






Member 1: Abel Diaz-Valdez


Responsibility: Layout/User interface/ Menu Option/Button

Member 2 : Ben Zuke


Responsibility: Board Logic/Board display


        - Used a 2d array as the back-end of the board using column/row logic
        - Front end was each of the images drawn over spaced out using the width of the tiles as    
the reference
- Hit testing on each column was the logic used, a clickListener() was used to avoid the issues discussed with onClick()
- Did not implement the dragging instead followed the spirit of being able to click anywhere on the board and have it drop to the bottom.
- !!!THE ABOVE was approved in interact @267 And was key to how our board works.
